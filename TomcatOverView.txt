1)Go to tomcat installation folder structure i.e in windows it is program files and in linux it is otp.
2)then go to C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache Tomcat 7.0.27\webapps
3) In webapps we can paste our application.
4)If we want to upload our application through browser then give ip address of your system(i.e go to cmd prompt and
give ipconfig you will get ip address) then paste ip in address bar of browser with port number and click enter.
5)then it will open ApacheFoundation page.
6)then click on manager button to upload your apps for that  u have to give username and pwd.
7)uname and pwd get in C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Apache Tomcat 7.0.27\conf\tomcatuser.xml
8)copy username and pwd in Apache browser page and go to deploy ment process.
9)we can deploy only war files.
